<h2>HASHTABLE - DYNAMIC_MEMORY : MULTITABLE</h2>

<h4>HASHTABLE.C</h4>
Standard hashtable - uses quadratic probing for part of the hashing algorithm.

The multi-part is not fully functional (read as: not really functional at all).

Table expansion to actual multi-table use is not yet working.

<h4>MAKEFILE</h4>
Standard makefile using **gcc** as the compiler.
